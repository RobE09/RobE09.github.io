  <h5>&nbsp;Introduction </h5>
  <p> During the summer of 2022, alongside some guys I’ve known since preschool, I took a trip out to Elephant Rocks State Park. This was my second time going that summer, as my girlfriend had taken me only a month prior. I thought this second trip was a little more exciting than my first trip because I knew all the cool spots to explore.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
  <h5>The Drive&nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
  <p> My group totaled six, and unfortunately none of us had a car that would seat more than five, so the journey began by splitting into groups of four and two. I was with one of my previously mentioned childhood friends, Steven, along with another buddy, Taylor, and his boyfriend, Jeydon. Steven was at the wheel and the second he got on the highway I decided I’d be riding back in the other car. He managed to catch up to the other car that had left a half hour before us.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
  <h5>In a Pickle&nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
  <p> We met up with the other two, Drew and Wes, right as we got there, and before any hiking, we thought it would be a genius idea to check out the little concession stand at the entrance. Our eyes locked onto a certain item on the menu, frozen pickle juice. Nobody thought it was a good idea, but we elected to ignore our logical side for the moment and we all had a serving of frozen pickle juice immediately before hiking in the 100+ degree weather. Was it nasty? Absolutely. Was it funny? Also, absolutely.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
  <h5>&nbsp;The Lake </h5>
  <p> Steven and I, being the experts of the park, led the rest of the group to a gorgeous earthen masterpiece of stone overlooking a lake (see Lakeside-Picture.jpg). We spent a lot of out time here skipping rocks and talking about how we need to get out more and dropping a few jokes. Before we moved on Drew had the bright idea to pee off the top of the ledge. He in fact did it once the coast was clear, he said, “It was a surprisingly freeing experience.”</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
  <h5>The Cliffs&nbsp; </h5>
  <p> After shimmying our way through some more narrow sections of the park, we made it to what we refer to as the cliffs, because it’s just a bunch of giant, or “elephant”, rocks stacked on top of one another to rise above all the surrounding trees. I took the lead there and forged a path to the top for Drew to follow. The others stayed lower than us for a fear of heights. Steven photographed me and Drew from below (see Cliffside-Picture.jpg). It was here that Taylor and Jeydon felt the effects of the pickled juice and elected to go back to the car while the rest of us pressed on and explored the rest of the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
  <h5>Wrapping Up&nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
  <p> Cooling down after four hours of hiking, Steven noticed something in the picture he took. He laughed and said, “There’s a dude in your knee!” (See left figure’s right knee in Cliffside-Picture.jpg). The man in my knee has since shown himself in other pictures, I’ve named him Giuseppe.</p>
